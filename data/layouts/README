SVG images have a dual purpose, providing an accurate representation of the
tablets and also providing the size and location of the various controls on
the device that can be queried by various applications that may need it.

To allow applications to identify each control in the SVG and also apply a
CSS if desired, the following naming convention applies:

* Buttons

Each button ID in the SVG is built of the string "Button" with ID of the
button between 'A' and 'Z':

    id="ButtonA"
    id="ButtonB"
    ...
    id="ButtonZ"

The SVG class must contain the button ID of the button between 'A' and 'Z'
and the more generic class "Button"

    class="A Button"
    class="B Button"
    ...
    class="Z Button"

If the button is a mode-switch button as well, the class list should also
contain "ModeSwitch":

    class="I ModeSwitch Button"

This would allow to modify the appearance of all the buttons at once via a CSS,
yet allowing to customize the appearance of single buttons by using the button
ID.

* Touch Rings/Strips

Touch rings use the following convention:

 - First touch ring:

    id="Ring"
    class="Ring TouchRing"

 - Second touch ring:

    id="Ring2"
    class="Ring2 TouchRing"

 - First touch strip:

    id="Strip"
    class="Strip TouchStrip"

 - Second touch strip:

    id="Strip2"
    class="Strip2 TouchStrip"

* Labels

The role of the labels in the SVG is to give applications an indication on
where to place the caption for each button. The actual content of the text
in the SVG image may not be relevant, what matters is the actual location.

Applications should hide the labels (using CSS) or replace the text with an
appropriate caption.

 - Button labels

Each button's label ID in the SVG is made of the string "Label" with ID of the
button to which it applies, between 'A' and 'Z'.

Class includes both the button ID and the string "Label".
    id="LabelA"
    class="A Label"

For the special case of mode-switch buttons, the class also list "ModeSwitch":

    id="LabelI"
    class="I ModeSwitch Label"

 - Touchring button labels

Touch-rings and touch-strips generate Up and Down events, therefore 2 different
labels are needed for each touch-ring/touch-strip control.

    id="LabelRingUp"
    class="RingUp Ring Label"

  and

    id="LabelRingDown"
    class="RingDown Ring Label"

The second touch-ring button is identified by "Ring2" in place of "Ring":

    id="LabelRing2Up"
    class="Ring2Up Ring2 Label"

  and

    id="LabelRingDown"
    class="Ring2Down Ring2 Label"

Touchstrips button follow the same naming scheme, using "Strip" and "Strip2"
to name the first and second touch-strip.

    id="LabelStripUp"
    class="StripUp Strip Label"

  and

    id="LabelStripDown"
    class="StripDown Strip Label"

Second touch-strip:

    id="LabelStrip2Up"
    class="Strip2Up Strip2 Label"

  and

    id="LabelRingDown"
    class="Strip2Down Strip2 Label"
